# Browser Trackpad Pinch Zoom

## Summary

Browser panes now handle the native AppKit magnification gesture and apply each finite gesture delta to the active `WKWebView.pageZoom`. The gesture uses the same `0.25...5.0` bounds and automation viewport limit as menu- and API-driven page zoom.

The implementation is intentionally narrow:

- `CmuxWebView.magnify(with:)` forwards `NSEvent.magnification` when a browser-panel handler is installed.
- `BrowserPanel` adds the delta to the current page zoom instead of replacing it, preserving continuous trackpad behavior.
- Missing handlers fall back to `super.magnify(with:)`.
- A weak, identity-checked callback prevents a replaced or stale web view from mutating the current browser.
- Existing zoom validation remains authoritative for non-finite input, zoom bounds, and the 4096 × 4096 automation viewport ceiling.

## Behavior contract

| Input | Result |
|---|---|
| Positive magnification delta | Increase the active page zoom additively |
| Negative magnification delta | Decrease the active page zoom additively |
| Non-finite delta | Ignore without changing page zoom |
| Delta beyond supported range | Clamp through the existing `0.25...5.0` zoom path |
| Magnification after profile/web-view replacement | Ignore the stale view callback |
| Magnification with no browser handler | Preserve the `WKWebView`/`NSResponder` fallback |

Navigation swipes, scrolling, editable focus, popups, and ordinary browser pointer handling are unchanged because the implementation overrides only AppKit's dedicated magnification responder callback.

## TDD coverage

The zoom-behavior tests were committed failing before the implementation. After implementation, a responder-boundary regression was added to exercise `CmuxWebView.magnify(with:)` directly with a controlled synthetic `NSEvent`. The final focused suite covers:

1. Event-delta routing only when a browser handler is installed.
2. Positive and negative deltas applied to the current zoom.
3. Rejection of `NaN` and infinity plus reuse of existing bounds.
4. Preservation of the 4096 × 4096 automation viewport render limit.
5. Ignoring a stale callback after browser-profile replacement.

## CI evidence

At validation checkpoint `2f59a17e5dba3341a2fb5360127ddb90c742be14`, the focused `BrowserPanelTrackpadMagnificationTests` suite passed all 5 cases with 0 failures on GitHub-hosted macOS 15 in run `30408134600`. The selected-test step was green. The workflow's overall conclusion was failure only because the subsequent result-publishing step could not create its external record from a fork context.

This was a focused contract run, not a claim that the repository-wide suite passed.

## Tagged application smoke

Run `30403009110` built exact validation checkpoint `2f59a17e5dba3341a2fb5360127ddb90c742be14` as `cmux DEV pinch-zoom-final-2f59a17` on macOS 15; its build metadata records that full source ref.

The installed artifact was launched on an Apple Silicon laptop running macOS 15.7.5 against a deterministic fixture served over loopback HTTP. The smoke used the same `WKWebView.pageZoom` mutation pipeline exposed to the gesture bridge:

| Observation | Reset | Three zoom-in steps | Reset after zoom |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| CSS viewport width | 760 px | 584 px | 760 px |
| CSS viewport height | 610 px | 469 px | 610 px |
| Browser-owned PNG size | 50,781 bytes | 53,987 bytes | — |

All smoke assertions passed:

- Zooming in reduced the CSS viewport width.
- Reset restored the original viewport width.
- The browser-owned PNG changed after zoom.

The before/after PNG SHA-256 values differed; the report omits them because the observable result is the changed rendered image rather than a machine-specific fingerprint.

## Validation boundary

The public Core Graphics event API does not expose a supported way to synthesize a physical trackpad magnification event. The automated evidence therefore divides cleanly:

- Unit coverage directly invokes `CmuxWebView.magnify(with:)` with an `NSEvent` test subclass whose magnification delta is controlled, proving that the responder override forwards the event delta into the installed callback.
- The remaining focused cases test the resulting panel zoom behavior and safety boundaries, and the tagged-app smoke proves that the page-zoom mutation changes and restores real WebKit rendering.
- A literal physical two-finger gesture was not programmatically injected, so the report does not claim HID-level event-delivery proof.

## API rationale

- [`NSEvent.magnification`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsevent/magnification) is the amount to add to the current magnification.
- [`NSResponder.magnify(with:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder/magnify(with:)) receives magnification gestures for the view under the touches.
- [`WKWebView.pageZoom`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview/pagezoom) is the existing page-zoom property used by browser controls and automation.

Using the native responder callback avoids scroll-wheel heuristics and keeps one zoom implementation for trackpad, menu, and automation paths.
